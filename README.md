# MoviesAPP
Moviezzie is a web application designed to help users discover movies and TV shows. 

It features a sleek, modern interface with glassmorphic design elements. Users can switch between searching for movies and TV shows, apply filters based on rating, year, and sort order, and view detailed information about each media item, including an overview, release date, rating, popularity, and cast. Users can also maintain a wishlist of their favorite movies and TV shows. The application fetches data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API and includes a settings modal to customize API key, language, and adult content preferences.
